# Days of Code #3 Pokedex_v1.1.0

Well, it didn't took too long till I skipped a few days in my daily code challange. But really, who gives a shit. It's not like I'm gonna fail some exam, loose job over some skipped days. Really nobody, including me. So I'm not gonna cry over spilled milk and continue coding, as well as I can. 

For my third day I decided to update my day 1 code project and I think it's getting way better and advanced in code compared to my first entry. Although I still dont completely understand the JS part. But I'm getting close

## WTF is new in v1.1.0?

### JS
- Using asynchronous functions to fetch data from PokeAPI
- Displaying and hiding popup using JS
- Fetch weight and height of each Pokemon 

### HTML&CSS
- Display additional information about Pokemon on click, which opens a popup
- Broke SCSS into partials for easier management



## What was used?
- ES6 fancy fetch methods, promises and all that async mumbo-jumbo used to fetch data using API's
- async await
- HTML and CSS (SCSS of course) for building the website

## What I learned
- About async await functions for fetching data
- how to create a popup using JS

## What I didn't understand
- Asyncronous functions

## How can it be improved
-[] Better UI
    -[] Flipping card?
-[] Search 
-[] Fetch on scroll
-[] Realized in some SPA
-[] Display more data about selected Pokemon and show it in an interesting way
